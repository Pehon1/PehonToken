# Pehon's Coin

## What?

A fun little project by [Pehon](http://ong.ph). 

#NFA Pehon's Coin isn't designed to be exchangable for anything. 

Pehon has always wanted his own coin, just for the fun of it. If you like some, reach out to [Pehon](http://ong.ph).

## Peculiarities

Pehon's Coin behaves much like any other ERC20 tokens out there, but the owner (likely to be Pehon) is able to do the following additional things:

- Mint coins into the owner's account
- Burn coins that is in any account
- Transfer coins from one person to another without needing anyone's permission

The owner pledges to only burn or steal from you when he dislikes you enough. 

## Contract

The contract has been deployed on Polygon.

Why Polygon? Cause its cheap.
